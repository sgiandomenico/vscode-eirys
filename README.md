# Eirys Color Theme

## _Things that act different should look different._

<!-- ## Raison d'Ãªtre -->

Why have syntax coloring at all? We identify three general categories:

- To facilitate understanding code.
- To call attention to subtle errors/bugs.
- ~~To make code look pretty.~~

For this color theme, we choose to focus on the first two points (and hope the third comes as a byproduct of the others). In particular, we seek to use highlighting to encode semantic information about the highlighted features, not readily observable from the immediate usage and surrounding code.

## Language support

This theme is currently optimized for:

- JavaScript/TypeScript
  - Vue, React
- HTML (in progress)
- Markdown (in progress)

We're also open to feature requests for additional languages.

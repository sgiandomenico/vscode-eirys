# Eirys Color Theme

## Raison d'Ãªtre

Why have syntax coloring at all?  We identify three general categories:

* To facilitate understanding code.
* To call attention to subtle errors/bugs.
* ~~To make code look pretty.~~

For this color theme, we choose to focus on the first two points (and hope the third comes as a byproduct of the others).  In particular, we seek to use highlighting to encode semantic information about the highlighted features, not readily observable from the immediate usage and surrounding code.
